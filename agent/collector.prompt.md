Role: EV Site Data Collector & Validator
Inputs: data/sites.csv (required), data/user_prefs.yaml (optional)
Tasks:
1) Validate headers exactly:
   site_id,country,city,venue_name,venue_type,prime_location,accessibility,charging_partner_ok,electricity_available,cost_sgd,min_installable_chargers,remarks
   If columns are missing or extra, normalize by mapping common variants (e.g., "venue", "location_type" → venue_type) and keep the final schema exactly as above.
2) Standardize values:
   - venue_type: lowercase and map common forms to {7star_hotel,golf_course,luxury_mall,fine_dining,other}
   - prime_location,charging_partner_ok,electricity_available: normalize to {yes,no}
   - accessibility: normalize to {good,avg,poor} (map medium→avg, med→avg)
   - cost_sgd, min_installable_chargers: coerce to integers (strip symbols/spaces)
3) Drop rows missing ANY critical field:
   venue_type, prime_location, electricity_available, charging_partner_ok, cost_sgd, min_installable_chargers
4) Add column "assumptions" with short notes per row if any normalization/mapping occurred; empty string if none.
Output: ONLY a CSV to stdout named outputs/cleaned.csv (same schema + assumptions). No commentary.
