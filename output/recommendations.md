This document provides the top-2 site recommendations for our next EV charging station deployment based on cost, accessibility, and strategic fit.

## Top-2 Recommended Sites

| site_id | venue_name       | city      | country   | TotalScore | strongest 2 factors |
|:--------|:-----------------|:----------|:----------|:-----------|:--------------------|
| TH-01   | Royal Greens     | Bangkok   | Thailand  | 0.75       | cost, accessibility |
| SG-01   | Marina Bay Grand | Singapore | Singapore | 0.70       | accessibility, prime location |

## Risks & Considerations

*   **Budget Sensitivity:** High operational costs are a primary constraint, with one potential site rejected for exceeding the defined budget.
*   **Location Viability:** A significant number of evaluated sites were unsuitable due to not being in prime locations or having poor accessibility.
*   **Venue Type Mismatch:** Our strict venue type requirements (luxury hotels and golf courses) significantly narrow the field of potential candidates.

## 7-Day Action Checklist

*   [ ] Confirm power grid capacity and any upgrade costs for TH-01 and SG-01.
*   [ ] Initiate formal partnership discussions with the management of both sites.
*   [ ] Conduct on-site visits to verify accessibility and map charger placement.
*   [ ] Finalize cost-benefit analysis using confirmed financial data.
*   [ ] Prepare draft term sheets for the top two candidates.
*   [ ] Review local regulations for EV charger installation in Bangkok and Singapore.
